puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and

again </s> let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good

</s> her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself </s> so you did old fellow </s> shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air </s> i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon </s> there s no pleasing them </s> persisted the king </s> oh dear what nonsense i m talking </s> said alice </s> thump </s> yes that s it said the hatter with a sigh it s always tea time and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles </s> well then the gryphon went on if you don t know what to uglify is you are a simpleton </s> you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on </s> the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well </s> ahem </s> it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh </s> alice didn t think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that you re mad </s> said the king </s> but i m not a serpent i tell you </s> alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five </s> said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to

thought to herself i don t see how he can even finish if he doesn t begin </s> but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream </s> may it please your majesty

people knew that then they wouldn t be so stingy about it you know she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear </s> all the

your pardon </s> so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation </s> and the gryphon added come let s hear some of your adventures </s> alice felt dreadfully puzzled </s> then you keep moving round i suppose </s> i vote the young lady tells us a story </s> the jury all looked puzzled </s> when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried </s> well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be </s> i almost think i can remember feeling a little different </s> what a curious plan </s> keep your temper said the caterpillar </s> come back </s> she waited for some time
