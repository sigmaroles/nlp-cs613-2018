different </s> as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it </s> oh dear </s> and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden </s> said the march hare </s> i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days </s> i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing </s> no said alice </s> you must be said the cat or

with the mouse in the middle </s> then it doesn t matter which way you go said the cat </s> alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could </s> would not could not would not could not could not join the dance </s> she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a

tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one </s> see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance </s> holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way </s> yes that s it said the hatter with a sigh it s always tea time and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles </s> then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains </s> yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you

when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it s so useful it s worth a hundred

this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brother s latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse

duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup </s> chapter xii </s> screamed the pigeon </s> the game s going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little </s> either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next </s> said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it s getting late </s> of course you don t </s> let s go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground </s> right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things </s> so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been </s> just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door </s> and where have my shoulders got to </s> does your watch tell you what year it is </s> you make me giddy </s> there s no pleasing them </s> she said to herself in a melancholy tone </s> where shall i begin please your majesty </s> oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope

the banquet what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you don t explain it as you go on </s> let me alone </s> alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing </s> said alice in a tone of great surprise </s> do you know why it s called a whiting </s> all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head </s> the queen </s> thank you said alice it s very interesting </s> she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves </s> her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself </s> i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter let s all move one place on </s> an invitation from the queen to play croquet </s> a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair </s> the mouse only growled in reply </s> hush </s> said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else </s> alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches </s> then yours wasn t a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief </s> at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes </s> in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of

</s> pleaded poor alice </s> come there s no use in crying like that </s> luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable

more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob i ve tried every way and nothing seems to suit them </s> if i don t take this child away with me thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two

</s> the mock turtle went on </s> they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun </s> it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied </s> how the creatures order one about and

the dance </s> there was exactly one a piece all round </s> oh you re sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough </s> the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head </s> the first witness was the hatter </s> it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes </s> now tell me pat what s that in the window </s> pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone </s> the gryphon replied very solemnly </s> hush </s> and how did you manage on the twelfth </s> alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn t matter a bit she thought to herself </s> hand it over here said the dodo </s> i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be‚Äù or if you d like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise ‚Äù i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i can t quite follow it as you say it </s> are you to get in at all </s> with extras </s> so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle s heavy sobs </s> that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then i shouldn t be hungry for it you know </s> in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that i m perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again </s> of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said there s a large mustard mine near here </s> you did </s> not i </s> the king s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you weren t to talk nonsense </s> i shall be late </s> i didn t mean it </s> from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle </s> said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing </s> oh you can t help that said the cat we re all mad here </s> you re wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea </s> but everything s curious today </s> it s really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue </s> tut tut child </s> i don t see any wine she remarked </s> still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens </s> besides she s she and i m i and oh dear how puzzling it all is </s> may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying i see </s> he was an old crab he was </s> what a funny watch </s> i thought you did said the mouse </s> when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable </s> said the dormouse indignantly </s> however i ve got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder </s> said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out </s> the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming </s> said alice </s> it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why </s> ah </s> dinah my dear </s> all persons more than a mile high to leave the court </s> where can i have dropped them i wonder </s> said the mouse to alice severely </s> said the lory hastily </s> alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldn t see it </s> said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table </s> i should like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet </s> how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit </s> i don t even know what a mock turtle is </s> please come back and finish your story </s> i ll set dinah at you </s> however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could </s> and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of yours ‚Äù oh i know </s> thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face </s> so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake </s> now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time </s> poor alice </s> shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began </s> for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went </s> this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding you re looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent </s> you know what to beautify is i suppose </s> it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isn t usual you know </s> and yet what a dear little puppy it was </s> you grant that </s> not quite right i m afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered </s> as far out to sea as you can swim after them </s> said the caterpillar sternly </s> the queen s argument was that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed all round </s> i do alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know </s> as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high </s> always lay the blame on others </s> you did said the mock turtle </s> and what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking </s> alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five </s> after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread and butter but what did the dormouse say </s> how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws </s> boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting </s> you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep‚Äù is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe‚Äù </s> the duchess the duchess </s> dinah ll miss me very much to night i should think </s> alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject </s> wow </s> what </s> well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height

when i was a child said the gryphon </s> cried the mock turtle capering wildly about </s> and when i grow up i ll write one but i m grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least there s no room to grow up any more here </s> why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes </s> at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow </s> this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do </s> who ever saw one that size </s> said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high </s> now if you only kept on good terms with him he d do almost anything you liked with the clock </s> give your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on the spot </s> if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were </s> i know what it‚Äù means well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm </s> alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore </s> anything you like said the footman and began whistling </s> the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness‚Äù did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness </s> the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn t sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know </s> give your evidence said the king </s> he asked </s> don t let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me </s> said alice </s> you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it </s> but it s no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people </s> said the caterpillar contemptuously </s> was heard in the distance </s> one of the jury asked </s> collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out </s> alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn </s> the question is what did the archbishop find </s> she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face </s> of course twinkling begins with a t </s> tell us all about it </s> pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles </s> said the queen turning purple </s> then you keep moving round i suppose </s> said the queen </s> she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die </s> where are you </s> she repeated in a wondering tone </s> this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance </s> do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it </s> well perhaps you haven t found it so yet

such a capital one for catching mice you can t think </s> the hatter shook his head mournfully </s> the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life </s> let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes that s about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to </s> the jury all brightened up again </s> this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again </s> the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone </s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way </s> he got behind alice as he spoke </s> alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station </s> why i wouldn t say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house </s> just think of what work it would make with the day and night </s> the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise

king </s> the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day </s> alice felt so desperate that she was
