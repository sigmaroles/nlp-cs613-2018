can t help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head </s> i think i may as well go in at once </s> the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until

otherwise ” i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i can t quite follow it as you say it </s> i won t indeed </s> never heard of uglifying </s>

lessons to learn </s> so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation </s> i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers

fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of

is </s> i don t know said the caterpillar </s> go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden ” alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would

another question </s> well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense </s> of course it was said the mock turtle </s> you re nothing but a pack of cards </s> please then said alice how am i to get in </s> so you see miss we re doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen </s> the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess

part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said that s very curious </s> said the king sharply </s> he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice </s> a cheap sort of present </s> go on with the next verse </s> please ma am is this new zealand or australia </s> some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air doesn t suit my throat </s> cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider </s> alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing </s> alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished </s> the duchess began in a low weak voice </s> alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation </s> pig </s> however he consented to go on </s> alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queen s voice in the distance screaming with passion </s> the rabbit asked </s> which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation </s> he asked </s> what for </s> once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on </s> however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand </s> you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever </s> well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it </s> cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended </s> come on </s> alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it </s> at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face </s> i don t see said the caterpillar </s> no i ve made up my mind about it if i m mabel i ll stay down here </s> all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert </s> i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice because i m not myself you see </s> said alice surprised at her own courage </s> well </s> so they couldn t get them out again </s> cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to

as he could go </s> thought alice i might as well be at school at once </s> however everything is queer to day </s> now you know </s> in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my

alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes that s about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to </s> that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air </s> and the gryphon never learnt it </s> it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual </s> if you don t know what a gryphon is look at the picture </s> please come back and finish your story </s> can you play croquet </s> i ve a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried </s> we called him tortoise because he taught us

you executed </s> i think that will be the best plan </s> and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection </s> the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations </s> as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent </s> what size do you want to be </s> that s very important the king said turning to the jury </s> i ve often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat </s> no i didn t said alice i don t think it s at all a pity </s> alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon </s> but she did not venture to say it out loud </s> i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation i ve none of my own </s> said the cat in a low voice </s> do i look like it </s> if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does </s> i ll try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale </s> what fun </s> first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs </s> at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes </s> everybody looked at alice </s> not at all said alice she s so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that it s hardly worth while finishing the game </s> i i m a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day </s> shy they seem to put everything upon bill </s> and the gryphon added come let s hear some of your adventures </s> it s really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue </s> come back </s> after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height </s> come on then </s> you are said the king </s> in which the cook and the baby joined wow </s> the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back </s> it s no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them </s> she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself that s quite enough i hope i shan t grow any more as it is i can t get out at the door i do wish i hadn t drunk quite so much </s> but i m not a serpent i tell you </s> if i d been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song i d have said to the porpoise keep back please we don t want you with us ” they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise </s> there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it </s> in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish they d get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments </s> he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you </s> but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now </s> ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on </s> i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen

to get to said the cat </s> the cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out but it just missed her </s> what will become of me </s> said the lory with a shiver </s> next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her </s> he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other </s> said alice to herself </s> on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him </s> alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home </s> shouted the queen </s> as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court </s> i m sure i don t want to stay in here any longer </s> poor alice </s> that s very curious </s> said the footman </s> what a curious feeling </s> for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off </s> it was too late to

with and oh </s> do come back again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them </s> their heads are gone if it please your majesty </s> everything s got a moral if only you can find it </s> so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing </s> fetch it here lad here put em up at this corner no tie em together first they don t reach half high enough yet oh </s> this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance </s> she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next </s> just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself </s> alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing </s> there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting </s> it s no business of mine </s> which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge </s> however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair ” as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes </s> the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on

bottom of a well </s> there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i don t like it yer honour at all at all </s> why she said the gryphon </s> alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore </s> they re done with blacking i believe </s> a likely story indeed </s> why not </s> twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop </s> she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people </s> i dare say there may be one </s> said alice </s> luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
