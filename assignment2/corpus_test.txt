why what are your shoes done with </s> said the gryphon </s> i mean what makes them so shiny </s> alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer </s> they re done with blacking i believe </s> boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting </s> now you know </s> and what are they made of </s> alice asked in a tone of great curiosity </s> soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that </s> if i d been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song

you mean purpose </s> said alice </s> i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone </s> and the gryphon added come let s hear some of your adventures </s> i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but it s no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then </s> explain all that said the mock turtle </s> no no </s> the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time </s> so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit </s> she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on </s> her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said that s very curious </s> it s all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon </s> it all came different </s> the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully </s> i should like to hear her try and repeat something now </s> tell her to begin </s> he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice </s> stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon </s> how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons </s> thought alice i might as well be at school at once </s> however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair </s> as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes </s> later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound </s> that s different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon </s> well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense </s> alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again </s> i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle </s> she can t explain it said the gryphon hastily </s> go on with the next verse </s> but about his toes </s> the mock turtle persisted </s> how could he turn them out with his nose you know </s> it s the first position in dancing </s> alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject </s> go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden </s> alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie later editions continued as follows the panther took pie crust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat </s> when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you don t explain it as you go on </s> it s by far the most confusing thing i ever heard </s> yes i think you d better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so </s> shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille </s> the gryphon went on </s> or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song </s> oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm </s> no accounting for tastes </s> sing her turtle soup will you old fellow </s> the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen </s> who for such dainties would not stoop </s> soup of the evening beautiful soup </s> soup of the evening beautiful soup </s> beau ootiful soo oop </s> beau ootiful soo oop

mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trial s beginning </s> was heard in the distance </s> come on </s> cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song </s> what trial is it </s> alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on </s> and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup </s> chapter xi </s> who stole the tarts </s> the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other </s> in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish they d get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments </s> but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time </s> alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there </s> that s the judge she said to herself because of his great wig </s> the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming </s> and that s the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors </s> she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all </s> however jury men would have done just as well </s> the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates </s> what are they doing </s> alice whispered to the gryphon </s> they can t have anything to put down yet before the trial s begun </s> they re putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial </s> stupid things </s> alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court </s> and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking </s> alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things </s> on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him </s> a nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over </s> thought alice </s> one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked </s> this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away </s> she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate </s> herald read the accusation </s> said the king </s> on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away </s> consider your verdict the king said to the jury </s> not yet not yet </s> the rabbit hastily interrupted </s> there s a great deal to come before that </s> call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness </s> the first witness was the hatter </s> he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other </s> i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadn t quite finished my tea when i was sent for </s> you ought to have finished said the king </s> when did you begin </s> the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm in arm with the dormouse </s> fourteenth of march i think it was he said </s> fifteenth said the march hare </s> sixteenth added the dormouse </s> write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence </s> take off your hat the king said to the hatter </s> it isn t mine said the hatter </s> stolen </s> the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact </s> i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation i ve none of my own </s> i m a hatter </s> here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted </s> give your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on the spot </s> this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter </s> just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her </s> i wish you wouldn t squeeze so </s> said the dormouse who was sitting next to her </s> i can hardly breathe </s> i can t help it said alice very meekly i m growing </s> you ve no right to grow here said the dormouse </s> don t talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know you re growing too </s> yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion </s> and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court </s> all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert </s> on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off </s> give your evidence the king repeated angrily or i ll have you executed whether you re nervous or not </s> i m a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread and butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea the twinkling of the what </s> said the king </s> it began with the tea the hatter replied </s> of course twinkling begins with a t </s> said the king sharply </s> do you take me for a dunce </s> go on </s> i m a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that only the march hare said i didn t </s> the march hare interrupted in a great hurry </s> you did </s> said the hatter </s> i deny it </s> said the march hare </s> he denies it said the king leave out that part </s> well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep </s> after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread and butter but what did the dormouse say </s> one of the jury asked </s> that i can t remember said the hatter </s> you must remember remarked the king or i ll have you executed </s> the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee </s> i m a poor man your majesty he began </s> you re a very poor speaker said the king </s> here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court </s> as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done </s> they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat upon it </s> i m glad i ve seen that done thought alice </s> i ve so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now </s> if that s all you know about it you may stand down continued the king </s> i can t go no lower said the hatter i m on the floor as it is </s> then you may sit down the king replied </s> here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed </s> come that finished the guinea pigs </s> thought alice </s> now we shall get on better </s> i d rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers </s> you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on </s> and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door </s> call the next witness </s> said the king </s> the next witness was the duchess s cook </s> she carried the pepper box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once </s> give your evidence said the king </s> shan t said the cook </s> the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness </s> well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of </s> pepper mostly said the cook </s> treacle said a sleepy voice behind her </s> collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out </s> behead that dormouse </s> turn that dormouse out of court </s> suppress him </s> pinch him </s> off with his whiskers </s> for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared </s> never mind </s> said the king with an air of great relief </s> call the next witness </s> and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross examine the next witness </s> it quite makes my forehead ache </s> alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they haven t got much evidence yet she said to herself </s> imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice </s> chapter xii </s> alice s evidence here </s> cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before </s> oh i beg your pardon </s> she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die </s> the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said do </s> alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move </s> she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other </s> as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court </s> what do you know about this business </s> the king said to alice </s> nothing said alice </s> nothing whatever </s> persisted the king </s> nothing whatever said alice </s> that s very important the king said turning to the jury </s> they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke </s> unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone important unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best </s> some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant </s> alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn t matter a bit she thought to herself </s> at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence </s> and read out from his book rule forty two </s> all persons more than a mile high to leave the court </s> everybody looked at alice </s> i m not a mile high said alice </s> you are said the king </s> nearly two miles high added the queen </s> well i shan t go at any rate said alice besides that s not a regular rule you invented it just now </s> it s the oldest rule in the book said the king </s> then it ought to be number one said alice </s> the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily </s> consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice </s> there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up </s> what s in it </s> said the queen </s> i haven t opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody </s> it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isn t usual you know </s> who is it directed to </s> said one of the jurymen </s> it isn t directed at all said the white rabbit in fact there s nothing written on the outside </s> he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a set of verses </s> are they in the prisoner s handwriting </s> asked another of the jurymen </s> no they re not said the white rabbit and that s the queerest thing about it </s> the jury all looked puzzled </s> he must have imitated somebody else s hand said the king </s> the jury all brightened up again </s> please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they can t prove i did there s no name signed at the end </s> if you didn t sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse </s> you must have meant some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man </s> there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day </s> that proves his guilt said the queen </s> it proves nothing of the sort </s> said alice </s> why you don t even know what they re about </s> read them said the king </s> the white rabbit put on his spectacles </s> where shall i begin please your majesty </s> he asked </s> begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop </s> these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim </s> he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you </s> i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before </s> if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were </s> my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it </s> don t let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me </s> that s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupting him i ll give him sixpence </s> i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it </s> the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper </s> if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any </s> and yet i don t know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all </s> said i could not swim you can t swim can you </s> he added turning to the knave </s> the knave shook his head sadly </s> do i look like it </s> he said </s> which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard </s> all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true that s the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice </s> why there they are </s> said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table </s> nothing can be clearer than that </s> then again before she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think </s> he said to the queen </s> never </s> said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke </s> the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted </s> then the words don t fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile </s> there was a dead silence </s> it s a pun </s> the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day </s> no no </s> said the queen </s> sentence first verdict afterwards </s> stuff and nonsense </s> said alice loudly </s> the idea of having the sentence first </s> hold your tongue </s> said the queen turning purple </s> i won t </s> said alice </s> off with her head </s> the queen shouted at the top of her voice </s> nobody moved </s> who cares for you </s> said alice she had grown to her full size by this time </s> you re nothing but a pack of cards </s> at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face </s> wake up alice dear </s> said her sister why what a long sleep you ve had </s> oh i ve had such a curious dream </s> said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it s getting late </s> so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been </s> but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream </s> the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchess s knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizard s slate pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle </s> so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle s heavy sobs </s> lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after time be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child life and the happy summer days </s> the end </s>
